# Content

This folder holds the lightweight, in-code content for the Teen Health starter site.

Origin
- This project was generated by ChatGPT from a prompt to take teenhealth.us brand + concepts and restyle it with a charity: water-like look and feel, while slimming down and consolidating pages.
- The content here is intentionally trimmed and structured to support fewer, clearer pages.

Files
- `content/programs.ts` - Program pillars used on `/` and `/programs`.
- `content/articles.ts` - Learn hub articles used on `/learn` and `/learn/[slug]` (also referenced by the sitemap).

Notes
- Articles use ISO date strings in `updated` (currently placeholders like `2026-01-01`).
- Categories are constrained to `Context`, `Programs`, and `Partnerships`.
- Content is plain TypeScript objects (no CMS/MDX yet).
